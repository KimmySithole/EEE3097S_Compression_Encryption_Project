# EEE3097S_Compression_Encryption_Project
An ARM based digital IP using the STM32F0 to encrypt and compress the IMU data
Remote sensing is the use of an autonomous device in a remote area to communicate with another network wirelessly. Remote sensing is critical in the Southern Ocean Seasonal Experiment’s (SCALE) endeavour to understand various environmental characteristics of the marginal ice zone in the Antarctic. The University of Cape Town’s (UCT) electrical engineering research group part of SCALE have built a remote sensing buoy that obtains data from the marginal ice zone. This buoy has been termed SHARC buoy and is built with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a host of other sensors. The data from the sensors is transmitted through an iridium satellite modem. Transmission through an iridium modem is, however, quite costly. Therefore, the research group would like to compress the data from the IMU and, furthermore, encrypt the data. Our task is to design an ARM based digital IP (Intellectual Property) to compress and encrypt the data from the IMU to alleviate the costs of iridium modem transmission and ensure the data is protected in transit.
